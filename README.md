# PSNProfiles Extra

This is an open source project to add additional features to PSNProfiles.com by creating a plugin for various browsers. I'm working on this project for personal purposes and it's my goal to learn how to create a browser extensions and NOT to imitate and/or create a copy of existing extensions.

## Current features

- Game page
  - Display link to a guide from the game list
- Guide page
  - All list and table items are checkable, and will be saved
  - Load trophies from a different platform (eg. guide is for PS4 and you're playing the PS5 version)
